# Adaptive-Cruise-Control-based-on-MPC
Simulation and Robotic Implementation of the Adaptive Cruise Control based on the Predictive Control Model
  - A nearly precise longitudinal model has been reached between two vehicles 
	- Tried to make control-response close to feasibility and real conditions.
	- Meet collision-avoidance and keeping the safe distance with leading car as main targets and comfort as a minor goal simultaneously. (control is applied on the following car)
  - implementation and simulation is applied on MATLAB.
